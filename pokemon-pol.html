 <h1>Pokémon: Path of Leaders</h1>
  <p><br>This is a unique fan-made Pokémon game (in my opinion). You can choose and play a short variation of the game 
    <br>where you get to choose between being a Pokémon trainer who later becomes a champion or a gym leader who later becomes one of the elite four. 
    <br>If you choose to play the long variation, you start as a trainer who becomes a champion. 
    <br>After becoming a champion, you become a gym leader who later becomes one of the elite four.</p>
