 <h1>Quadball Mania</h1>
  <p><br>This is a sports manager game. You play as a manager of a quadball team. You can create your own or choose an existing one. 
    <br>There are different tournaments but when you play as a manager of a team (if you are lucky) you only play 3 tournaments the basic tournament (where you start playing), 
    <br>the Grand Master League (where the 20 best teams play) and the World Cup (world championship). 
    <br>You have to think about the economy and which players to choose like a normal sports manager game.</p>
