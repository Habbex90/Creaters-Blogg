                  <p>Here are my Pokémon Fan Games made with "Pokemon Essentials" and "Rpg Maker XP".</p>
    
          <div><h5><a href="pokemon-pol.html">Pokémon: Path of Leaders</a></h5></div> 

                  <p>This is "Pokémon: Path of Leaders" in this game you can choose between the short version and the long version. 
                    If you choose the short version you can choose whether you want to be a trainer who later becomes a champion or 
                    if you want to be a gym leader who later becomes an elite four member. 
                    If you choose the long version you will start as a trainer who later becomes a champion 
                    after that you will become a gym leader who later becomes an elite four member.</p>
    
          <div><h5><a href="pokemon-ad.html">Pokémon Arctic Dark</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is Pokémon Arctic Dark. It is a regular Pokémon game in a region based on Sweden. 
                    With fakemon that fits into a Swedish region. 
                    There are Pokémon and missions in this version that are not in the next version.</p>

                    With fakemon that fits into a Swedish region.

      <div><h4>My Own Games</h4></div>
    
          <div><h5><a href="qmm.html">Quadball Mania Manager</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is a sports manager game. The sport of Quadball is a team sport that is 
                    a mix of: Rugby, Handball, Dodgeball, running and flag football.I think it's pretty fun!</p>

          <div><h5><a href="qmm.html">Quadball Mania Player Manager</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is a sports manager game where you are the manager of one player not an entire team. 
                    This game is also made with the sport of Quadball. If you succeed with one player, 
                    you will get more people who want you as a manager and if you fail, you will go bankrupt.</p>

          <div><h5><a href="qmm.html">Quadball Mania</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is a 2D sports game like NHL 94, NBA Jam Tournament Edition, MLB 98, FIFA: Road to World Cup 98 
                    and Madden NFL 96. It is based on the sport Quadball like the games before this.</p>


          <div><h5><a href="qmm.html">The World of Ezeret</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is one of my dream games. It's called "The World of Ezeret". 
                    It's an RPG where you choose between four characters (Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher). 
                    The power of all characters is to take the finder's skills. 
                    The first thing you choose between Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher is only the dispatch, a Magus can also use mele skills and a Poacher can also use heal. 
                    So it's only the dispatch of your character you choose here. A character doesn't get any skills from leveling up, they just get better stats. 
                    You get skills from the enemy and you have to choose carefully because you can only take one of the enemy's skills. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's an example, we have a Skeleton soldier, Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter and a Skeleton priest as enemies. 
                    You can only choose one of these finder's skills. So if you choose a skill from the Skeleton soldier, you can't choose from the Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter or Skeleton priest. 
                    You can also only choose one of the Skeleton soldier's skills. Once you have taken a skill from the Skeleton monsters you have to wait until you meet the next 
                    type of enemy but they will have completely different skills from the Skeleton. 
                    So this is a game that challenges your way of thinking. What kind of character do I have? What play style do I want?</p>


          <div><h5><a href="qmm.html">Pitborn</a></h5></div>

                  <p>This is my second dream game. It's an RPG/Survival game. You get to choose between 3 monsters. The monsters are Skeleton, Goblin or Undead.
                    There is also a fourth choice but it will be a surprise. The game is about you being a monster that is born in a dungeon.
                    You are the weakest monster in the dungeon. So you have to survive, you have to collect materials and build a shelter from other monsters and people.
                    You have to create weapons and equipment so that you can defeat the monsters that are stronger. When you defeat monsters that are stronger, you level up and become stronger yourself.
                    The goal of the game is to become so strong that you can defeat the dungeon master and become the dungeon master yourself. 
                    After you become the dungeon master, you have to collect materials and monsters to develop the dungeon.
                    You have to develop the dungeon so that it becomes more difficult for people but also other monsters you do not control to reach you.
