    <h1>The World of Ezeret</h1>
      <p>This is one of my dream games. It's called "The World of Ezeret". 
        It's an RPG where you choose between four characters (Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher). 
        The power of all characters is to take the finder's skills. 
        The first thing you choose between Combatant, Cleric, Magus and Poacher is only the dispatch, a Magus can also use mele skills and a Poacher can also use heal. 
        So it's only the dispatch of your character you choose here. A character doesn't get any skills from leveling up, they just get better stats. 
        You get skills from the enemy and you have to choose carefully because you can only take one of the enemy's skills. 
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example, we have a Skeleton soldier, Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter and a Skeleton priest as enemies. 
        You can only choose one of these finder's skills. So if you choose a skill from the Skeleton soldier, you can't choose from the Skeleton wizard, Skeleton hunter or Skeleton priest. 
        You can also only choose one of the Skeleton soldier's skills. Once you have taken a skill from the Skeleton monsters you have to wait until you meet the next 
        type of enemy but they will have completely different skills from the Skeleton. 
        So this is a game that challenges your way of thinking. What kind of character do I have? What play style do I want? (Under construction)</p>
