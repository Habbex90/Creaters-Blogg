    <h1>Pitborn</h1>
      <p>This is my second dream game, it's an RPG/Survival game and it's name is Pitborn. You get to choose between 3 monsters. The monsters are Skeleton, Goblin or Undead.
        There is also a fourth choice but it will be a surprise. The game is about you being a monster that is born in a dungeon.
        You are the weakest monster in the dungeon. So you have to survive, you have to collect materials and build a shelter from other monsters and people.
        You have to create weapons and equipment so that you can defeat the monsters that are stronger. When you defeat monsters that are stronger, you level up and become stronger yourself.
        The goal of the game is to become so strong that you can defeat the dungeon master and become the dungeon master yourself. 
        After you become the dungeon master, you have to collect materials and monsters to develop the dungeon.
        You have to develop the dungeon so that it becomes more difficult for people but also other monsters you do not control to reach you. (Under construction)</p>
